TabShare is an application that will help you split the cost of night's out with your friends:

```
- As a user I want to create an event and add people to it 
- As a user I want to have a quick and accurate way to settle a bill sharing with my friends
- As a user I can see history of all the events and current open transaction
- As a user I can also use it on my smarthphone(PWA)
```

```
